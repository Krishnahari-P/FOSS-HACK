Carbo:
It's an interface for public and UNFCC which is the authority responsible for giving carbon credit.


The problem Carbo solves:
The logged and registered user can upload his projects, all after procedures are our responsibility to do.So we can provide an optimized atmosphere for user and UNFCCC. We are facilitating the process and are providing carbon credits as NFTs ,more secure way to do this kind of things.Carbon credits can be turned into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to store and track the ownership of carbon credits. This would provide a secure and verifiable way to track the ownership and transfer of carbon credits while ensuring that the credits remain securely stored. The use of NFTs would provide a transparent, secure, and immutable way to monitor the ownership and transfer of carbon credits. The use of NFTs would also ensure that the owners of the carbon credits are able to track the progress of their carbon credits and that the credits remain securely stored.
